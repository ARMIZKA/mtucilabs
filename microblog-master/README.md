# Microblog
Objective: create a wall site with two input forms: for a name and for a message.

Progress:
1. Install Flask.
2. Let's create some files (app.py, microblog.py, __init__py, routes.py) and fill them.
3. Create a templates folder and add files (index.html and base.html) to it to set the sizes of the fields in which data will be entered.
4. With the help of Bootstrap (front-end open-source toolkit) we connect the finished design.
5. Include the style in the index.html file.
